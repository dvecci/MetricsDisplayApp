# MetricsDisplayApp
The Metrics Display App processes a set of users and user data, and will display cards for each user with that user's information and associated campaign data.

The application uses Grunt as it's build system, and optimizes using Grunt's requirejs optimizer. 
MetricsDisplayApp.html will use the optimized code in the build file, whie MetricsDisplayApp.html-development
will use the raw code in the App folder. This allows for development without having to rebuild to test changes.
